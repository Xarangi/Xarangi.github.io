# Comm Labs Assignment 1: "R U S H"

## 1. Introduction and Description

This assignment delves into the creation of a film and an accompanying website that examine the concept of losing track of time in the midst of a rush.

The website is divided into four sections: index, about, bios, and a unique Pomodoro timer. While the design was inspired by a template, it required substantial tweaking to comply with the project's vision. For example, a hamburger menu was included to improve navigation for mobile devices.

The plot of the film revolves around a student who forgets about his forthcoming class while working out in the gym, causing a frantic rush. The design of the website hopes to embody this feeling of a "rush" and finally leave watchers with a temporary solution to manage their time better!

## 2. Process

The creative process for this assignment was long and winded. Upon submitting my original wireframe, I had difficulties in executing on it from scratch due to my relatively limited experience with web development. 

After learning in class, that we could use templates to enhance our work and help with our visions. I attempted to find one that could help me, but this proved difficult too. At long last, I managed to find a relatively minimalist template which included some sample animations that I believed would be useful. 

However, this was a template for a one-page website and was severely limited in its scope. While keeping some core design elements from the template, which I believed meshed well with my original vision, I redesigned the website from the ground up to sell the chaotic vision of the film.

The index/about page attempts to tell a story, to reel the viewer in and remind them of times they have felt the way the protagonist of the film is feeling. The movie page is relatively basic, but includes a short bloopers section, talking about a couple incidents from our filming. The bio page also incorporates a sliding animation element. Finally, the pomodoro timer is an attempt to leave the viewer with a tool with which they can perhaps avoid such a situation from arising.

Finally, further effort was spent in ensuring the website was fully responsive for devices of different screen sizes.

## 3. Evaluation/Reflection

While I attempted to make the website design appealing and in touch with the subject, there are a few improvements that could improve the user experience further:

- Improving/implementing further accessibility features such as better alt text for images and keyboard navigation to make the website more inclusive.
- Improve the storytelling component by introducing more interactive aspects relevant to the film's narrative. Interactive sceneries or clickable pieces, for example, that provide more context or insights into the plot. For example, the font choices could be inspired by the idea of a 'Rush' in some way.
- User Feedback: Include user feedback methods, like as surveys or comment areas, to collect visitor input and opinions, enabling for continual improvement.
- Optimized Performance: Make sure the website loads swiftly and efficiently in order to give a seamless surfing experience, especially for those with slower internet connections. (currently the movie page takes long to load)

These changes would further take me a lot of time to implement, and I am relatively happy with my results for this assignment.

Overall, I believe this assignment helped me learn a lot about the medium of web development to tell an all-inclusive story. I hope to further improve my skills to get better at this medium as the course progresses.
